  about:
    heading: "Born from darkness, fueled by emotion"
    image: "./assets/images/band-image.webp"
    bio:
      - "In the shadows between light and sound, we emerged. Not as entertainers, but as vessels for raw emotion. Our soundâ€”a haunting echo in the void of conventional music."
      - "We don't perform; we channel. We don't entertain; we express. Each track is a fragment of consciousness, each note a pulse of existential contemplation."
      - "The past isn't gone. It's reverberating through our instruments, one haunting melody at a time."
